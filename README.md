**Important Java Coding Questions for Interview**

1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort


________________________________________________________________________________________________
**1. Bubble Sort**

Time Complexity: O(N^2)

Space Complexity : O(1)

**a. Advantages of Bubble Sort:**

1. Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.

2. It does not require any additional memory space.

3. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

**b .Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:**

1. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.

2. Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which means that it requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order of elements in the input data set.

**2. Insertion Sort**

**a. Time Complexity of Insertion Sort**

1. The worst-case time complexity of the Insertion sort is O(N^2)

2. The average case time complexity of the Insertion sort is O(N^2)

3. The time complexity of the best case is O(N).

4. Space complexity of Insertion Sort is O(1).

**b. Characteristics of Insertion Sort**

1. This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithms with a simple implementation

2. Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values

3. Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets that are already partially sorted.
