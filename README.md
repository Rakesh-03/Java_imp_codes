________________________________________________________________________________________________
**1. Bubble Sort**

Time Complexity: O(N^2)

Space Complexity : O(1)

**a. Advantages of Bubble Sort:**

1. Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.

2. It does not require any additional memory space.

3. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

**b .Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:**

1. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(N2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.

2. Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which means that it requires a comparison operator to determine the relative order of elements in the input data set.

**2. Insertion Sort**

**a. Time Complexity of Insertion Sort**

1. The worst-case time complexity of the Insertion sort is O(N^2)

2. The average case time complexity of the Insertion sort is O(N^2)

3. The time complexity of the best case is O(N).

4. Space complexity of Insertion Sort is O(1).

**b. Characteristics of Insertion Sort**

1. This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithms with a simple implementation

2. Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values

3. Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets that are already partially sorted.

**3. Selection Sort**

**a. Complexity Analysis of Selection Sort**

1. Time Complexity:  O(N^2) 

2. Space Complexity: O(1)

**b. Advantages of Selection Sort Algorithm**

1. Simple and easy to understand.

2. Works well with small datasets.

**c. Disadvantages of the Selection Sort Algorithm**

1. Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.

2. Does not work well on large datasets.

3. Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys which means it is not stable.

**4. Cyclic Sort**

**a. Time Complexity Analysis:**

1. Worst Case : O(n) 

2. Average Case: O(n) 

3. Best Case : O(n)

4. Space complexity : O(1)

**b. Advantage of Cycle sort:**

1. No additional storage is required.

2. in-place sorting algorithm.

3. A minimum number of writes to the memory

4. Cycle sort is useful when the array is stored in EEPROM or FLASH. 

**c. Disadvantage  of Cycle sort:**

1. It is not mostly used.

2. It has more time complexity o(n^2)

3. Unstable sorting algorithm.
